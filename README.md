## 📁 Repository Structure

Navigate to the project folder:

cd House-Price-Prediction-ML

Install required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the prediction app:

streamlit run app.py

🛠️ Usage

Make sure the dataset and trained model file (model.pkl) exist

Update input features as needed

Run the Python application to get price predictions

📈 Results

The trained model provides predictions based on input features. You can expand this project by integrating a web interface (Flask/Streamlit) or deploying as an API.

📌 Notes

This project is a Machine Learning learning exercise

Model performance depends on the dataset used
